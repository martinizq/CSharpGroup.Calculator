# CSharpGroup.Calculator
A starting point for beginners who would like to learn WPF and MVVM.  

I'm part of a community(group) in FB where we like to discuss C# projects.   One of our members wanted to start a calculator project (Asad Ahmad Khan), therefore from his request, this idea came about.

I'm starting the project as means to also learn about group collaboration.  

Feel free to join and collaborate.  Please be courteous and helpful.  

Attitude free zone.  

Thanks!
